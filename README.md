## Overview

Describe your web application, its purpose, and main features briefly.

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository


   Install Dependencies:   npm install
   ```

Ensure your browser's local storage is enabled.

## Functionality

The web application includes the following features:

## User Authentication:

Register new users with username and password.
Authenticate existing users during login.
Store user credentials securely using local storage.
Session Management:

Maintain user sessions across different pages.
Allow users to logout to end their session.

## Landing Page:

Display a list of items fetched from src/data.js.
Implement CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on items.
Allow filtering and sorting of items based on different criteria.

## Item Management:

Add new items with a form.
Edit existing items inline.
Delete items from the list.
Assumptions
During development, the following assumptions were made:

User authentication and session management are handled using local storage for simplicity.
Passwords are stored using bcryptjs encryption.
The application does not include backend APIs; data manipulation is done using React state and local storage.
Basic styling is applied for user interface components without focusing extensively on design aesthetics.
Code Quality

## The codebase maintains the following standards:

Modular Structure: Components are organized into reusable modules (src/components/) for better maintainability.
Meaningful Naming: Variables and functions are named descriptively to enhance code readability.
Documentation: Important functions and complex logic are documented using comments for clarity.
Consistent Formatting: Code is formatted using ESLint/Prettier to ensure consistency across the codebase.

## Running the Project

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

## Start the Development Server:

npm start

Access the Application:
Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to view the application.

## Testing Credentials:

Register a new user or use the provided credentials to login.

Navigate through the application to explore its features including item management, filtering, sorting, and CRUD operations.
